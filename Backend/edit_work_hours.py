# edit_work_hours.py

"""
This file provides the backend functionality for Senior Project Managers to manage and
correct employee work hours. It allows for the editing, removal, and addition of shifts.

The functions are designed to be called from a user-friendly interface where the
Senior PM can select an employee from a list and a specific date. The system
then handles the necessary Firestore database operations based on the provided
information, without exposing technical details like Firebase UIDs to the end-user.

    (New Helper Function)
    Rewrites the entire log sheet for a given location for the current pay period.

    the sheet always matches the Firestore database.

    # Implementation would involve:
    # 1. Getting the gspread client.

    # 3. Determining the current pay period (e.g., Aug 1-15 or Aug 16-31) and sheet name.
    # 4. Fetching ALL shifts from Firestore for the given 'location' within the entire pay period.
    # 5. Getting the worksheet by its name. If it doesn't exist, create it.
    # 6. Clearing all data from the worksheet.
    # 7. Writing the header row back to the sheet.
    # 8. Formatting the fetched Firestore shifts into rows.
    # 9. Writing all the fresh rows to the sheet in a single batch update.
